# Diamond-Prices-MongoDB

## Description
- I have created a MongoDB database using the [Diamond Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vittoriogiatti/diamondprices) dataset.
- Using python I created a database, created a document for each row in the dataset, validated the data and inserted it to my database.
- I have queries and also queries that manipulate the data
