# Diamond-Prices-MongoDB

## Description
- I have created a MongoDB database using the [Diamond Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vittoriogiatti/diamondprices) dataset.
- Using python I created a database, created a document for each row in the dataset, validated the data and inserted it to my database.
- I have made queries that manipulate the data and also queries that draws new data from the dataset.
